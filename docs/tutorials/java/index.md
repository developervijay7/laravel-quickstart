# Tutorial for Java

Are you new to Java? Let's start with a very simple HelloWorld.

Open your favorite text edtitor, name it as **HelloJava.java** and copy-and-paste the following content.

```java
public class HelloJava {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
     System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
  }
}
```

You need to have Java SDK first. Once you have that, run the following commands in sequence.

```bash
javac HelloJava.java
java HelloJava
```

Now, you should see "Hello, World" printed out in the console!
