# About Laravel Quick-Start

Laravel Quickstart is a bolierplate for Laravel Application with typical packages preinstalled and configured to extend a full fledged application. We tried to make it as minimal as possible.

Here are some of its features:
- Separate Views, Routes, Controllers directories for Frontend(Public Interface) and Backend(Admin Interface)
- Both Frontend and Backend utilizes [TailwindCSSv3](https://tailwindcss.com/) as frontend framework
- User Management [Laravel Fortify](https://github.com/laravel/fortify) package, with social login [Socialite](https://github.com/laravel/socialite) and Roles and Permissions [Spatie Laravel Permissions](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package
- Integrated [Log Viewer](https://github.com/ARCANEDEV/LogViewer)


We are trying to make the package easier to deploy.
